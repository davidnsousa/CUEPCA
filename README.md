# Cooperation under ecological pressure: Cognitive adaptations (CUEPCA)

Put this folder inside the Netlogo main folder.

Reproducibility material:

```
CUEPCA.nlogo
```

All experiments (E1 to E6) in the netlogo behavior space can be run through the bash script:

```
bash run.sh
```
The output is saved in the same folder. Use

```
Rscript results.R
```

to produce all plots.

We suggest that all experiments are run in a cluster. Please note the R dependencies in results.R.
